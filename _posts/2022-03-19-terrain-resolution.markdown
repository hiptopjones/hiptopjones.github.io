While investigating the unexpectedly jagged path, I looked more closely at the underlying mesh.

The mesh is a square grid of 1x1 quads on the XZ plane, with height values encoded in Y.  Since the height values come from Perlin noise, they should result in a smooth mesh.

However, there are a lot of unexpected ridges in the mesh.

Looking at it from another direction, itâ€™s actually stratified.

By applying the source noise map as the mesh texture, we can see that the grayscale values are not as we'd expect.

The height values at every point should be fairly unique due to sampling the noise curves, but here they appear to fall into just a few well-defined buckets.
