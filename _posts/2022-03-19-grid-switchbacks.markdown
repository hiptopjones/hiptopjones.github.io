With the result of fixing the cost calculation, I wondered if the grid terrain could now be improved simply by using the recursive neighbors code.

![Grid Switchbacks]({{ "/assets/images/GridSwitchbacks.png" }})

Huh!  Looks like.  Not as pretty in some ways, more pretty in other ways.

So maybe I didnâ€™t need to bother with the whole contour / triangulation rabbit hole?  Oh well, I learned a heck of a lot about computational geometry.
