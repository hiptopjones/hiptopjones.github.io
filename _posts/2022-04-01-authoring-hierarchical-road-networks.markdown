> I find research papers to often be difficult to grok as they are written for people already immersed in that domain.  However, the concepts are generally accessible to the layman if expressed with appropriate context.  I am calling this a "Layman's Teardown" in reference to teardowns of complex electronic assemblies.

The paper we are going to teardown is the following:

* [Authoring Hierarchical Road Networks](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01354487/file/network-author-version.pdf) by E. Galin, A. Peytavie, E. Guerin, B. Benes

## Introduction

### Related Work

### Contributions

The paper creates a framework for generating roads that is "constrained", which just means that the pathfinding must pass through or avoid specific areas.

The pathfinding model accounts for typical terrain costs like slope, but also includes municipal areas and other roads for more control over the route.

The paper selects a subset of the generated roads
