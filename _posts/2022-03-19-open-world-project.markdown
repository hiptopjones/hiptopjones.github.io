I had been cycling through some topics related to game development (rendering, 3D modeling, music creation).  These are things I want to get better at to be able to create a more complete game.  But I didnâ€™t really have a particular goal in mind, something to focus my effort.

At some point, I landed on the idea of driving through landscapes with little purpose other than relaxation and exploration.  I enjoy driving, and mostly do it by myself.  Exploring new roads and appreciating old ones.

In my research, I came across references to FUEL.  This is a racing game from back in 2009 that has an huge open world with free roaming ability.  It takes *hours* to drive across the map.

Okay, so the goal is to create a procedurally-generated world for the purposes of driving through it.  It needs to be big enough and detailed enough to be interesting, but it cannot be hand-crafted since I'm only one person.

This is a project idea with lots of mainline and sidebar challenges to pick away at, and might be a good way to funnel energy to a single result.
