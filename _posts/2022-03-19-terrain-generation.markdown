The first thing is to generate some terrain.

**Sebastian Lague’s** tutorials are fantastic.  I watched this series a couple of times and was able to produce my own generation project:

* [Procedural Landmass Generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbpMiKiSKm8&list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eBW2EiBtl_sxmDtSgZBxB3)

**Penny de Byl’s** Udemy course was really helpful as well:

* [Procedural Terrain Generation with Unity](https://www.udemy.com/course/procedural-terrain-generation-with-unity/)

The following screenshots are the result of these efforts:

Here are the inspector settings used to produce that landscape:
