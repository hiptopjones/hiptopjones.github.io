I now had a terrain and some basic pathfinding.  However, using a color map as the texture was making it hard to visually test if the pathfinding was working correctly since there could be a lot of height variation within a color.

To solve this, I created a contour image.  The contours are drawn by drawing black pixels where the height value is very close to an integer value.  Everything else is gray (or white in later versions).

![Contour Texture]({{ "/assets/images/Contours1.png" }})

Using this as the texture for the mesh, I could try to pick points along a contour and see if the path would generally prefer to follow contours between endpoints.
